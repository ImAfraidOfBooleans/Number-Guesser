# Number-Guesser
This is a simple C++ program that implements a number guessing using a binary search technique.

### How to Use

The program will ask you to input the highest number you want to choose, and then begin guessing based on your responses.

Then, the program will output the guessed number and you to enter a response indicating whether the guessed number is **too low (enter 0), too high (enter 1), or correct (enter 2).** 


***The code only work with Whole Number at the moment***
