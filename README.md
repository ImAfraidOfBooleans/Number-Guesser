# Number-Guesser
The code implements a number guessing game that uses a binary search strategy. The user selects a maximum number and the program asks questions to guess the number the user is thinking of. The program starts by guessing the middle number between the possible range of numbers and asks the user whether the number to be guessed is lower, higher, or equal to the middle number. Depending on the user's response, the program adjusts the search range and repeats the process until it correctly guesses the number or the user indicates that the guessed number is correct. If at any point the search range is reduced to a single number and it does not match the user's guessed number, an error message is output.
